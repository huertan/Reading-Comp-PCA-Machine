# Reading-Comp-PCA-Machine
The goal of this project was to determine if the Simple View of Reading components, word reading and language comprehension, were sufficient to predict reading comprehension or if executive function should also be included in the predictive model. The analysis used a principle component analysis and a machine learning approach to determine if variables related to word reading, language comprehension and executive function reduced to these components and  predicted reading comprehension of 8-12 year-old readers. 10-fold cross validation and stepwise feature selection were utilized. R was used for all analysis, specifically the tidyvrse, ggplot2, caret and psych packages. For access to data, please contact me at natalie.huerta@vanderbilt.edu.
